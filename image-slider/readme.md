### README

This project consists of a simple carousel implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The carousel displays a series of images and associated information, allowing users to navigate through them using navigation buttons.

#### HTML
The HTML structure includes a header with navigation links and a main section containing the carousel. Each carousel item is represented by an `<article>` element, containing an image, title, topic, description, and buttons for interaction. Additionally, there is a thumbnail section for displaying preview images of the carousel items.

#### CSS
The CSS file (`style.css`) contains styles for the layout, typography, and animations of the carousel and its components. Key features include responsive design, image formatting, button styling, and animation effects for sliding transitions.

#### JavaScript
The JavaScript file (`script.js`) provides functionality for navigating through the carousel. Event listeners are attached to the next and previous buttons, allowing users to move forward or backward in the carousel. Additionally, automatic sliding functionality is implemented, advancing to the next slide after a specified interval.

#### Features
- Responsive design: The carousel adjusts its layout to fit various screen sizes.
- Navigation buttons: Users can manually navigate through the carousel using next and previous buttons.
- Automatic sliding: The carousel automatically transitions to the next slide after a set interval.
- Thumbnail preview: Thumbnail images provide a visual preview of the carousel content.

#### Usage
To use the carousel, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Users can click the next and previous buttons to navigate through the carousel manually. The carousel also supports automatic sliding, transitioning to the next slide after a specified interval.

#### Future Improvements
- Improved accessibility: Enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support for better accessibility.
- Customization options: Allow users to customize carousel behavior, such as slide duration and animation effects.
- Dynamic content: Implement functionality to load carousel content dynamically from external sources.
